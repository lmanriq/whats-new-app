# What's New?

## Application Overview

This application loads news stories from an external API and allows users to filter stories based on topic and search them for specific keywords. It was built using React and was tested using snapshot in Jest. This is my first React-based JavascriptApplication, and it helped me learn functional and class-based React components as well as understand a new testing library.
